# Wireless ECG Monitoring System (NRF24L01)

This project presents the design and development of a **wireless ECG monitoring system** using **AD8232 ECG sensor**, **NRF24L01 module**, and **Arduino**.  
The system captures real-time ECG signals and transmits them wirelessly using the NRF24L01 transceiver. Data is processed and visualized through a **mobile dashboard**, enabling continuous remote health monitoring.
